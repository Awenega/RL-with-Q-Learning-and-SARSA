# Reinforcement Learning with Q-Learning and SARSA
This repository implements reinforcement learning solutions for the classic "Taxi" problem using Python and Gymnasium. The project explores two approaches to optimize the taxi's routeâ€”Q-learning with a Q-table and Q-function approximation using neural networks. The repository includes the SARSA learning algorithm, Q-table updates with epsilon-greedy policies, and Q-function approximation with a neural network, leveraging a replay buffer for improved learning stability. Parameter tuning and performance analysis are conducted to maximize cumulative rewards and minimize penalties, showcasing both approaches' advantages for discrete versus continuous state-action spaces.
